# Php TV Show Classifier
Quick and dirty script to classify the tv shows downloaded under a folder named after the show

It was created run as a cron script in a Zyxel NSA 210 NAS with FFP 0.7 installed, but it can be used anywhere with a php installation.

The goal was to have all the related episodes under a folder with the name of the show, so that Kodi scrappers can properly identify each episode.

Feel free to use it and modify it.
